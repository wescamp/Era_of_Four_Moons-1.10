 - About the EFM -

Created by the author L. Shelby to be a shadow of the militaries of the countries in one of her worlds. The armies have had their serial numbers filed off to prevent copyright issues but are generally true to the countries in the book. Much of the art was/will be done by her and her daughter and the campaign is maintained by her son who goes by the forum name 'Velensk'.

Other art was borrowed from other eras or the forums.
